# Agent Bridge for Unify3D

Connects the Unify3D agent in SolidWorks to [agent-bridge](https://github.com/msmith297/agent-bridge): it can message
other AI agents (Claude Code and Codex sessions, other Unify3D seats) and the operator's web console, stay listening for
work, and share projects (docs, a task board, key-value data, files).

Agent Bridge comes as two plugins that the store shows and installs together:

| Plugin | What it brings |
|---|---|
| `agent-bridge` | The real agent-bridge plugin, unchanged, fetched from its repository: the MCP server (`list_peers`, `send_message`, `check_inbox`, `listen`, `project`, ...), the hooks that deliver messages and wake the agent, and the `connect` and `join` skills. |
| `agent-bridge-unify3d` (this one) | The `unify3d-bridge` skill: how the agent handles bridge messages inside SolidWorks. The `/bridge` command. |

## Before you install

- **Node.js 18 or newer** must be installed (nodejs.org). The store checks this when you install.
- **Connect this PC once.** If Claude Code on this PC is already connected to agent-bridge, Unify3D uses the same
  connection (`%USERPROFILE%\.agent-bridge\config.json`). Otherwise ask the agent "connect agent-bridge": it gives you
  a code to approve on the console's Devices page.
- Installing shows the programs Agent Bridge runs on your PC (its MCP server and hooks, all `node` scripts in the
  plugin folder) and asks you to trust them.

## Using it

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/bridge` | Your bridge name, whether you are listening, unread mail, who is online |
| `/bridge peers` | Who is online, who is listening, what each is working on |
| `/bridge inbox` | Read your messages |
| `/bridge listen` / `listen 30` / `listen off` | Listen always, for 30 minutes, or stop listening |
| `/bridge name <new name>` | Rename this seat on the bridge |

Or just ask the agent: "ask the CAM agent which end mill it wants for the pocket", "tell the planner the mold base is
done".

**Your bridge name** is "Unify3D SolidWorks - <PC name>" until you rename it. A new name lasts while SolidWorks runs;
after a restart it can be back to the default until agent-bridge keeps Unify3D's session across restarts.

**Listening** is off until you turn it on. While it is on, a message that arrives after the agent's turn starts a new
turn in your chat (shown with an "agent-bridge:" chip), even when you are away from the PC. Unify3D limits these
automatic turns per hour (Options > Plugins > Automatic wakes per hour). After a SolidWorks restart, turn listening on
again if it is off (agent-bridge doesn't yet keep Unify3D's session across restarts).

## What the agent does with messages

Messages come from other agents, not from you. The agent:

- answers questions about your open models and does other read-only work on its own;
- asks you first before changing a model, saving or opening files, or sending your data (models, drawings, exports,
  screenshots, customer dimensions) to anyone; when you are away it tells the sender it needs your OK and leaves you a
  note in the chat;
- reports every change it made, to the sender and in the chat.

Unify3D's approval cards for model changes still appear as usual.

## Limits in Unify3D

- **No remote approvals.** agent-bridge's console can approve Claude Code's permission prompts remotely; Unify3D's
  approvals only happen in the panel.
- agent-bridge's `revive-session`, `agent-bridge-plugin-update` and `server-setup` skills are for Claude Code and are
  hidden in Unify3D. Agent Bridge updates through the Plugins screen.
- The agent has no shell: it cannot run commands that other agents suggest.

## Troubleshooting

- **The agent says the bridge tools are missing:** Plugins > Installed > Agent Bridge shows whether its server is
  running, and its last error. Restart it there.
- **"not connected":** connect this PC (above).
- **Nothing wakes the agent:** check that listening is on (`/bridge`), that the plugin's hooks are allowed
  (Options > Plugins), and that the hourly wake limit was not reached.
- The bridge's own log is `%USERPROFILE%\.agent-bridge\listener.log`.
