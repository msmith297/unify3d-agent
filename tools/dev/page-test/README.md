# Page test - checking the PropertyManager page options in SolidWorks

`tools/dev/page-test` is a developer tool whose page uses every page option added for the compression-mold tool:

- cascading data choices (`ChoicesFrom`, `ChoiceKey`, `DependsOn`, `RowFilter`, `ValueMap`), including a choice under an options input;
- `Fills`, including a value stored in another unit (`|psi`) and null values that hide a field;
- converted units: pressure, temperature, mass, force, tonnage, viscosity, time. Each one shows in the document's system;
- per-field `UnitChoices`;
- `Optional`/`Enabled`, the `size` type (2 and 3 boxes) and `info` lines;
- `ShowWhen` driven by a choice and by a checkbox;
- `Remember`, `GroupExpanded`, and a required Optional;
- 12 groups plus the Unify3D Agent group;
- the original options (length, angle, plain number, choice, checkbox), which must behave exactly as before.

The unit tests (`tests/SwAgent.Tests/ToolDataTests.cs`, `UnitsTests.cs`, `ToolSpecTests.cs`) already check the page logic without SolidWorks. That logic lives in the headless form, `ToolForm` in `src/SwAgent/Tools/ToolData.cs`. This checklist covers what only SolidWorks can show: whether the native controls follow the form.

The data in `data/*.json` is test data in the shape of the mold tool's files. It is not material data.

## Install

1. Build and register the add-in as usual.
2. Copy this folder to `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\tools\page-test`. The folder name must be `page-test`.
3. Restart SolidWorks. "Page test" appears on the Unify3D tab, in category Developer.
4. To start clean, delete these two files:
   - `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\tools\last-inputs\page-test.json` (remembered values);
   - `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\tools\page-quirks.json` (fallbacks the page chose, see below).

Run the test twice: once in a new part with **MMGS** units, then once in a new part with **IPS** units.

## Spikes S1-S6 (design 2.1.6)

The page code is written to work whatever these spikes show. Each spike tells us which code path your SolidWorks takes. Where a spike fails, a fallback is switched on in `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\tools\page-quirks.json`:

```json
{ "comboRefill": "dynamic", "rangeAfterShow": true, "hidden": "hide" }
```

The page writes the first two values itself when it detects a failure; it shows a message and asks you to reopen the page. The third value can only be set by hand. When you change the file, reopen the page.

| Id | What to do | Pass | If it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Switch **Mold material** between the two options a few times. Change **Grade** in Part material. Watch `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SwAgent\logs\swagent-<date>.log` for "handling a change ... failed". | The grade lists and filled fields follow every change, and nothing flips back on its own. Record whether SolidWorks fires change events for values the code sets: the page works either way, because the `_quiet` guard and the form ignore repeats. | Note what flipped back, and send the log. |
| S1b | In MMGS, pick Part material **Rubber - EPDM** (grade EPDM 70A), tick the required limit, press OK and read the payload in chat. | `Molding pressure` reads `10.3421 MPa` with no "edited by the user". This tells us that number boxes keep the digits the code writes; a 0.5 % echo filter covers boxes that round. | Note the payload line. |
| S2a | Switch **Mold material**, then **Part material** family. | The **Plate grade** and **Grade** dropdowns change their entries immediately, without flicker or a crash. | The page saves `"comboRefill": "variants"` and asks you to reopen. After that, the page makes one dropdown per entry list and shows only the active one. Check that this works too. |
| S2b | In **Press pressure**, change the unit dropdown under the box: psi, then bar, MPa, kgf/cm². | The box shows the same pressure in the new unit, with no clamping. For example, 2000 psi becomes 137.9 bar, 13.79 MPa and 140.6 kgf/cm². The caption reads "Press pressure (bar)". | The page saves `"rangeAfterShow": false`, puts the unit back, and asks you to reopen. After that, unit boxes get a range wide enough for every unit. The real range is checked before OK: type 200 MPa and OK greys out with a bubble. |
| S3 | Pick **Tool steel**: Insert grade disappears. Pick Rubber - EPDM: Mixed viscosity and Pot life disappear and Mooney appears. Tick **Show the extra note**. Also watch the info lines (Full strength to ..., Liquid pour ...). | Hidden controls collapse their space, shown ones reappear in place, and info captions repaint at once. | If space isn't collapsed: cosmetic, note it. If hiding misbehaves (controls overlap, or the page draws wrongly), set `"hidden": "disable"` by hand. Hidden inputs then stay in place, greyed out. |
| S4 | Look at **Heated platen size** and **Max size per plate**. | The boxes are stacked vertically, with Width, Depth and Thickness pictures. Side by side is a later polish. If you can, record the units of `IPropertyManagerPageControl.Top/Left/Width` (dialog units or percent) for that. | Nothing to change in v1. |
| S5 | (Track D, not this page.) In a part, rename a body with `IBody2.Name = "x"` in an `execute_csharp` cell. Rebuild, save, close and reopen. | The name persists. | The mold tool falls back to folders plus geometric order (its default). |
| S6 | Count the groups: 12 plus "Unify3D Agent". Click into controls in the last groups and change them. | Every control works. No group steals a control's events. Group ids now come from the same counter as control ids, so they can't collide. | Send the log. |

## The page script (design 6.2, about 15 min)

Tick each item in both an MMGS and an IPS part.

- [ ] **Cascade.** Part material → Grade: the grade list follows the family, and the Process data group (collapsed at start) fills in. Mold material → Plate grade: aluminium shows 6061-T651, 7075-T651 and MIC-6; steel shows P20 and H13.
- [ ] **Edit, re-pick, overwrite.** Change Shrinkage to 1.8 and press OK: the payload reads `1.8 % (table 1.5 % - edited by the user)`. Run again and pick the 70A grade: Shrinkage becomes 1.7 (picking a grade overwrites edits).
- [ ] **Null hides.** Rubber - EPDM hides Mixed viscosity and Pot life; the payload says `n/a for this grade`.
- [ ] **ShowWhen.** Mold material = Tool steel hides Insert grade. Press pressure is = On the part hides Gauge at rated force; Press rated force stays visible (critique C2). The checkbox shows and hides Extra note.
- [ ] **Optional on/off.** Platen size and Daylight start off: their boxes are grey and the payload says `not set`. Tick them: the boxes enable and the values are sent.
- [ ] **Required Optional.** OK stays grey until "Required limit (switch on)" is ticked. A bubble explains why, once.
- [ ] **Sizes.** 2 boxes for the platen, 3 for the plate.
- [ ] **Units.** IPS shows psi, °F, lb, lbf and US ton. MMGS shows MPa, °C, kg, kN and t. Defaults are round in both systems: 2000 psi, 3000 psi, 50 US ton, 212 °F, 50.7 lb.
- [ ] **Remember.** Change Press pressure (and its unit), Press rated force, Cycle life and the grades, then press OK. Run again: those values and units come back. Press temperature and Cavities don't (not remembered). Cancel never stores anything.
- [ ] **Payload.** The chat shows the `<tool_inputs>` block (the tool's agent echoes it). Compare it with the expected lines below.
- [ ] **Groups.** 13 groups, no id collision (S6). "3 Process data" and "12 Decisions & notes" start collapsed (`GroupExpanded: false`).
- [ ] **Original options.** Group 11 looks and behaves as before: Legacy length shows document units with the depth picture, Legacy angle shows degrees, Legacy plain number is a plain box, the choice is a dropdown, the checkbox is ticked.
- [ ] **Existing tools unchanged.** Run **Smart Rebuild** and the user tools (flash-grooves, parametric-block, pu-compression-mold). Compare their pages with screenshots from before this change: same controls, captions, defaults and payload.

- IPS: "Full strength to 248 °F, derated to 302 °F" and "... molding 50 psi".

Extra note is left out of the payload while hidden.

The macro's output (in the chat after the block) lists every input as `Inputs` sees it. Check these:
- numbers are SI: `press_pressure` number=13790000 (Pa); `press_temp` 100 (degC); `pot_life_min` 360 (s); `viscosity_cp` 1.2 (Pa*s);
- `daylight` limit=null while off;
- `max_plate_size` size=[0.6, 0.4, 0.15] m;
- `part_grade` row.id=pu-tdi-ether-90a;
- `extra_note` hidden=True.
