# Writing a Unify3D plugin

For people who write plugins for Unify3D Agent by hand, and for checking what the built-in plugin creator
(`tools/builtin/create-plugin`, also `/new-plugin`) produces. The runtime behind it is specified in
[design.md](design.md); where this page and the design differ, this page describes the corrected contract the add-in
implements.

A Unify3D plugin is a **Claude Code plugin** plus, optionally, **Unify3D tools**. A folder that works in Claude Code
installs in Unify3D unchanged, as far as its parts apply (section 2), and a Unify3D plugin's commands, skills, agents,
hooks and MCP servers work in Claude Code.

## 1. The folder

```
my-plugin/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      required: the manifest
  README.md                       shown in the store's detail view
  commands/<name>.md              slash commands
  skills/<skill>/SKILL.md         skills (plus any extra files in the skill folder)
  agents/<name>.md                sub-agents
  hooks/hooks.json                hooks
  .mcp.json                       MCP servers
  tools/<tool>/TOOL.md ...        Unify3D tools and workflows (Unify3D only)
```

Everything except `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is optional.

### plugin.json

```json
{
  "name": "pu-mold-shop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "displayName": "PU Mold Shop",
  "description": "Flash grooves, the mold-base workflow and drawing checks for a PU compression-mold shop.",
  "author": { "name": "Jane Toolmaker", "email": "jane@example.com" },
  "homepage": "https://example.com/pu-mold-shop",
  "repository": "https://github.com/example/pu-mold-shop",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["molding", "polyurethane"],
  "userConfig": {
    "erp_url": { "type": "string", "title": "ERP address", "description": "Base URL of the shop's ERP", "default": "" },
    "erp_key": { "type": "string", "title": "ERP API key", "sensitive": true }
  },
  "unify3d": {
    "category": "Molding & Toolmaking",
    "icon": "./icon.png",
    "tools": "./tools",
    "minAddInVersion": "0.2.0"
  }
}
```

- `name`: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,47}$` (kebab-case, 2-48 characters). It prefixes everything the plugin adds, so
  keep it short.
- `version`: semantic version. Raise it with every change you share. A plugin without one (agent-bridge has none) is
  versioned by its source commit.
- `commands`, `agents`, `skills` (a path or an array of paths), `hooks` (a path or an inline object) and `mcpServers`
  (a path or an inline object) work as in Claude Code: extra locations next to the default folders.
- `userConfig`: settings the user fills in under Plugins > Installed. A `sensitive` value is stored encrypted (DPAPI)
  and never shown again.
- `unify3d`: Unify3D-only fields. Claude Code does not use them.

  | Field | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | `category` | The store group. Each tool keeps its own `category` for the ribbon and the Workflows menu. |
  | `icon` | A tool icon name (`macro`, `part`, `assembly`, `drawing`, `tree`, `select`, `camera`, `rebuild`, `gear`, `book`, `markup`, `shield`) or a path in the plugin, e.g. `./icon.png` (128 x 128, transparent). |
  | `tools` | Where the Unify3D tools are, default `./tools`. |
  | `minAddInVersion` | The oldest Unify3D Agent version the plugin needs, e.g. `0.2.0`. |
  | `env` | Extra environment variables for this plugin's own hooks and MCP servers (section 5). |

## 2. Claude Code compatibility

| Part | Claude Code | Unify3D |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin.json` fields | all | all; `unify3d` added |
| Commands | yes | yes: `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`-`$9`, `@path`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `model`; `allowed-tools` is advisory; `` !`cmd` `` is **not run** (left as text, with a note) |
| Skills | yes | yes: listed in the agent's skills index, loaded with `use_skill`, extra files read with `read_plugin_file` |
| Agents | yes | yes, through `run_agent`; tool names Unify3D doesn't have (`Read`, `Bash`, `Edit` ...) are dropped, and an agent left with none gets read-only tools |
| Hooks | yes | `type: "command"` only, six events (section 6); run with Git Bash as in Claude Code, or `cmd.exe` on a PC without Git for Windows |
| MCP servers | stdio, HTTP, SSE | stdio, HTTP and SSE; no OAuth (section 7) |
| Output styles, LSP servers, `settings.json`, status line | yes | ignored |
| `tools/` (Unify3D tools) | ignored | yes (section 3) |
| `unify3d` in `plugin.json` and marketplace entries | ignored | yes |

### Commands

```markdown
---
description: Check a mold drawing against the shop rules
argument-hint: "<drawing or 'active'>"
model: claude-sonnet-5-5
---
Check $ARGUMENTS against the drawing rules in @reference/drawing-rules.md and list every problem with its sheet and view.
```

- Invoked as `/<plugin>:<command>`, or `/<command>` when no other command has that name.
- The expanded text is sent as the user's message, with a chip that shows the command.
- `@relative/path` reads a file of the plugin (never outside it).

### Skills

```markdown
---
name: drawing-rules
description: The shop's rules for mold drawings (tolerances, title block, views). Use when checking or making a mold drawing.
---
```

The `description` is all the agent sees until it loads the skill: say what is inside and when to use it. The user
can also run a skill as `/<skill>` and point the agent at it with `@`.

### Agents

```markdown
---
name: drawing-checker
description: Reviews a drawing against the shop rules. Use for a second opinion before release.
tools: get_model_context, get_feature_tree, capture_views, list_open_documents
model: inherit
---
You are a careful drawing checker ...
```

`tools` lists Unify3D agent tools; `execute_csharp`, `undo` and `rebuild` change the model, everything else reads.
`model` is `inherit`, `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `fable` or a model id. Aliases resolve to the user's provider: on a
chat that runs on OpenAI, `haiku` is GPT-6 Luna, `sonnet` GPT-6.1 Sol, `opus` and `fable` GPT-6 Astra; a model id of a
provider the user has no key for becomes the same tier on the chat's provider. The body is the whole system prompt of the sub-agent,
which does not see the chat. Sub-agents can't use the panel's `ask_*` tools.

## 3. Unify3D tools in a plugin

`tools/<tool>/` holds a tool or workflow folder exactly like the user's own (`%APPDATA%\SwAgent\tools\<tool>`) and the
built-in ones (`tools/builtin/<tool>` in this repository): `TOOL.md` with front matter, optional `inputs.json` (the
tool's inputs page), `macro.cs`, `preview.cs`, `icon.svg` / `icon.png`, and any data files.

- In Unify3D a plugin tool is named `<plugin>:<tool>` (e.g. `pu-mold-shop:flash-grooves`): on the ribbon, in the
  Workflows menu, in `[Run tool: ...]` / `[Run workflow: ...]` and for `read_user_tool`. Inside the plugin, refer to
  sibling tools by that full name.
- Installed plugin tools are read-only like the built-in ones; the user's settings for them (intelligence, category,
  remembered inputs) are kept outside the plugin, under the full name. Tools in a **local** plugin
  (`plugins\local\<name>`) stay editable with `edit_user_tool`.
- Tools reach the ribbon after a SolidWorks restart; workflows appear at once.
- Disabling the plugin removes its tools.
- `requires:` in `TOOL.md` names agent tools the tool needs. Use it for tools that need a newer add-in, or MCP tools
  of the plugin's own servers.
- `tools/<tool>/profiles/*.json` ship ready-made profiles of the tool's inputs (`docs/tool-profiles.md`), e.g. "PU shop
  starter". Users see them with a lock: they load and duplicate them, but can't change or delete them. Write one by
  saving a profile in the tool's form and exporting it, or copy `tools/builtin/design-compression-mold/profiles/`. The
  plugin creator's `plugin_add_tool` ships the user's saved profiles of a tool with `profiles: true`.
  `plugin_validate` checks every value against `inputs.json`.

### Helpers for the agent's code

`helpers/<ClassName>.cs` (next to `tools/`; `"unify3d": { "helpers": "./other" }` moves it) holds C# helpers the
agent's code cells can call, compiled together with the helpers the agent writes itself (`save_helper`):

- One file per helper: `namespace SwAgent.UserHelpers { public static class <ClassName> { ... } }`, the class named
  like the file. Extension methods are allowed (that is how a helper makes a wrong-interface call such as
  `Model.GetComponentByName(...)` work); one that a built-in extension already defines (`Model.FeatureByName`,
  `x.AsDoubles()`, ...) is refused. Other types go inside the class. The cells' usings apply (System, Linq,
  SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks / swconst, the built-in `SwAgent.Scripting.Extensions`, ...) plus
  `SwAgent.Scripting.Helpers`. The built-in helpers (`Bodies.*`, `Features.*`, `Sel.*`) reserve those class names.
- A helper has none of the cells' globals (`Model`, `swApp`, `mm`/`deg`, `Print`, `Bodies`/`Features`/`Sel`): it takes
  `IModelDoc2 model` as a parameter and works in meters and degrees. To build on the measured built-in helpers, take
  `BodiesApi` / `FeaturesApi` / `SelApi` as a parameter or this-receiver: `public static IBody2 TurnInPlace(this BodiesApi
  bodies, IBody2 b, string axis, double degrees)` is called `Bodies.TurnInPlace(b, "X", 90)` in a cell, and the index
  shows it that way.
- Optional header lines: `// summary: <one line for the agent's helper index>` (else the class's XML summary) and
  `// wraps: IModelDocExtension.InsertMoveCopyBody2, ...` (a cell that calls one of these raw is told to use the helper).
- Helpers are code that runs inside SolidWorks: they count as tool code for trust (section 8), so they run only once
  the user approved this exact code. A helper that doesn't compile, or clashes with another, is skipped; the others
  still work. Plugin helpers win a name clash with the agent's own, and the agent can't change or delete them.

## 4. Variables

Expanded in hook commands, MCP `command` / `args` / `env`, `unify3d.env` values, and command and skill text:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `${UNIFY3D_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | The installed plugin folder (read-only; replaced on update) |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` | `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\plugins\data\<plugin>`: writable, survives updates |
| `${UNIFY3D_DEVICE}` | This PC's name |
| `${UNIFY3D_PID}` | The process id of SolidWorks (`SLDWORKS.exe`) |
| `${user_config.<key>}` | The user's value for a `userConfig` key |
| `${NAME}`, `${NAME:-default}` | An environment variable of the hook or MCP server (section 5); **not** in command and skill text |

Command and skill text goes to the model, so it gets only the plugin variables and non-sensitive `userConfig` values:
any other `${...}` stays as written, and SolidWorks' environment is never read into it. Hook commands run by Git Bash
are left for bash to expand (only `${user_config.<key>}` is put in first), exactly as in Claude Code; with `cmd.exe`,
Unify3D expands `${...}` itself from the hook's environment. Keep `sensitive` `userConfig` values off command lines and
out of `args`: read them from the environment (section 5).

## 5. The environment of hooks and MCP servers

Every hook and MCP server of a plugin gets the add-in's environment plus:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | The plugin folder |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` | The plugin's data folder |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | `%USERPROFILE%` (Unify3D has no project folder) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` | The Unify3D session id (the same as `session_id` on hook stdin) |
| `UNIFY3D` | `1`, so a script can tell it runs under Unify3D |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>` | Each `userConfig` value, key in capitals (sensitive ones too) |
| the plugin's `unify3d.env` | After the marketplace entry's `unify3d.env` (section 8); `userConfig` wins over both |

`PATH` is refreshed from the registry, so a Node.js installed after SolidWorks started is found. Your AI provider keys
are never in a plugin's environment: every `ANTHROPIC_*` and `OPENAI_*` variable is hidden, and `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` or
`${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}` expand to nothing. A plugin may still give its own MCP server `OPENAI_API_KEY` from its own
`userConfig` (`"env": { "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${user_config.openai_key}" }`); `ANTHROPIC_*` and `CLAUDE_CODE_*` can't be
set.

**The session.** Unify3D has one session id per PC, kept in `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\plugins\session.json` and reused after
every restart (a second SolidWorks running at the same time gets a temporary one). `/clear` and new chats keep the
session. Several chats can run under one session.

**Working folder.** Hooks and MCP servers start in `%USERPROFILE%`, and `cwd` on hook stdin is the same folder. Use
absolute paths. A hook that needs the active document gets it as `unify3d_document` on stdin (when the panel knows
one).

## 6. Hooks

Claude Code's hook format and protocol (`hooks/hooks.json`, or `hooks` in `plugin.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "execute_csharp|rebuild",
        "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "node \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/log.mjs\"", "timeout": 15 } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Support matrix

| Event | Fired in Unify3D | When | stdin extras |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | yes | Once per session, when the panel first loads, after the enabled MCP servers have started (or 30 s). The matcher is matched against `source`. | `source: "startup"` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | yes | Before a prompt the user typed, a queued user message or a ribbon tool run is sent. Not for agent-bridge style wake-ups or Stop continuations. Not in sub-agent runs. | `prompt` |
| `PreToolUse` | yes | Before any agent tool, before validation and the approval card (also MCP tools, panel tools and in sub-agents) | `tool_name`, `tool_input` |
| `PostToolUse` | yes | After the tool returned | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_response` |
| `Stop` | yes | The agent's turn ended normally (not on abort, error, refusal or step limit). Not in sub-agent runs. | `stop_hook_active` |
| `SessionEnd` | yes | SolidWorks closes or the add-in disconnects; best effort, 3 s | `reason` |
| `PermissionRequest` | **no** | Unify3D's approval cards can't be answered by a hook (so agent-bridge's remote approvals don't work) | |
| `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, others | **no** | | |

| Hook field | Unify3D |
|---|---|
| `type: "command"` | yes |
| `type: "prompt"`, `type: "agent"`, HTTP hooks | no |
| `matcher` | regex on the tool name for `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` (empty or `*` = all); on `source` for `SessionStart` |
| `timeout` (seconds) | yes, default 60; long-running async hooks may use up to 604800 (a week) |
| `async: true` | yes: the turn doesn't wait |
| `asyncRewake: true` + `rewakeMessage` | yes (below) |

### Running

- Commands run as Claude Code runs them on Windows: with Git Bash (`<Git>\usr\bin\bash.exe -c "<command>"`, found
  through `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH`, `git.exe` on `PATH` or the usual install folders, with Git's `usr\bin` and
  `mingw64\bin` in front of `PATH`), so `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `${VAR:-x}`, `2>/dev/null`, `.sh` scripts and single
  quotes work. On a PC without Git for Windows they run as `cmd.exe /d /s /c "<command>"`, where that bash syntax
  fails (the hook exits non-zero, a logged, non-blocking error); `plugin_validate` warns about it. The form that works
  with both: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/x.mjs"`. No window either way, in the plugin's environment (section
  5), outside SolidWorks and off the UI thread; the shell is the hook's parent and SolidWorks its grandparent. A hook
  never touches SolidWorks; to change the model it would have to go through the agent.
- stdin: one JSON object, UTF-8 without BOM, then stdin is closed. Common fields: `session_id`, `transcript_path`,
  `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `permission_mode: "default"`. There is no `turn_id` (scripts that support Codex treat
  `turn_id` as Codex). `transcript_path` is a JSONL export of the chat the event belongs to, under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SwAgent\plugins\transcripts`.
- `tool_response` is `{ content: [text blocks; images as "[image]"], isError }`, up to about 100 KB.
- Several hooks for one event run in parallel.
- Timeouts, disabling the plugin and SessionEnd kill the hook's whole process tree.
- Hook stdin is never logged.

### Outputs

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success. stdout may be JSON (below). For `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart`, plain text on stdout is added as context. |
| 2 | Block: stderr is the reason. `PreToolUse`: the tool is denied. `UserPromptSubmit`: the prompt is not sent and goes back to the composer. `Stop`: the turn continues with the reason. |
| other | A non-blocking error, logged |

JSON on stdout (exit 0):

- `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`: `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart` and `PostToolUse` add it to the model's
  context. After a tool it is a separate text block after the tool results (so clearing old tool results doesn't
  remove it); after a prompt it shows in the chat as a context card, not as the user's words.
- `decision: "block"` with `reason`: `Stop` continues the turn with the reason; `PostToolUse` adds the reason after
  the tool result.
- `PreToolUse`: `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` `allow`, `deny` or `ask`, with `permissionDecisionReason`.
  `ask` shows Unify3D's approval card for that call.
- `continue: false` with `stopReason`: the run stops.
- `systemMessage`: shown to the user as a notice.

When several hooks answer: any block wins; deny beats ask beats allow; contexts are joined; any `continue: false`
wins.

### Async hooks and wake-ups

With `async: true` the hook runs in the background. With `asyncRewake: true` as well, when it exits with code 2 its
stderr (stdout if stderr is empty), prefixed with `rewakeMessage`, wakes the agent:

- it starts a new turn in the session's wake thread (the chat used last, else a new workspace chat named after the
  plugin), shown with a system-event chip; when that chat is busy (a run, a question, an approval or a form waiting),
  the wake waits until it is done;
- wakes and `Stop` continuations together are limited per hour (Options > Plugins > Automatic wakes per hour,
  default 20); over the limit they wait for the user's next prompt, with a notice;
- a wake is kept until it is shown in a chat, also across a panel reload.

This is how agent-bridge's background listener (`Stop` / `SessionStart` with `--listen`) works.

## 7. MCP servers

`.mcp.json` (or `mcpServers` in `plugin.json`), the Claude Code shape:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "erp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp/erp.mjs"],
      "env": { "ERP_URL": "${user_config.erp_url}" }
    }
  }
}
```

A remote server, with its key in a header (never in the URL):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acme": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.acme.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${user_config.api_key}" }
    }
  }
}
```

| MCP feature | Unify3D |
|---|---|
| stdio transport (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0) | yes |
| Streamable HTTP (`"type": "http"`): JSON or SSE answers, `Mcp-Session-Id`, `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `DELETE` at the end | yes |
| The older HTTP+SSE transport (`"type": "sse"`, or an `http` server that refuses the POST with 400/404/405) | yes |
| `headers` with `${user_config.<key>}` (sensitive values included) and `${ENV}` | yes; values are never logged, URLs are logged without their query |
| OAuth sign-in | no: a 401 without a configured header says "needs OAuth - not supported yet" |
| A standalone GET stream for server messages in Streamable HTTP | no (`list_changed` is seen when an answer stream carries it) |
| `initialize` (protocol `2025-06-18`, client `unify3d-agent`), then `notifications/initialized` | yes; `initialize` may take up to 45 s, 3 minutes for `npx`, `uvx`, `pipx`, `bunx` and `docker` (the first start downloads) |
| Server `instructions` | yes: added to the agent's system prompt |
| `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `notifications/tools/list_changed` | yes |
| Tool results: text, images, `isError` | yes |
| Cancelling a call (`notifications/cancelled`) | yes, when the user stops the run |
| `ping`, `roots/list` from the server | answered |
| `sampling/*`, `elicitation/*` from the server | refused (`-32601`) |
| Resources, prompts | no |

- **Tool names.** A plugin server's tools are `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>` (as in Claude Code); a server
  from the user's `%APPDATA%\SwAgent\mcp.json` gets `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Names longer than the API's 64
  characters are shortened with a hash.
- **Schemas.** `inputSchema` must be an object schema; `$schema` is dropped, and a top-level `anyOf` / `oneOf` is not
  accepted.
- **Life cycle.** A server starts when its plugin is enabled (at SolidWorks start or on enable), restarts with
  backoff when it exits, and stops on disable and at SessionEnd (stdin is closed first, so it can clean up; then its
  process tree is ended).
- **Process.** A `command` that is an `.exe` (`node`, `python`) is started directly, not through `cmd.exe`, so the
  server's parent process is SolidWorks. The working folder is `%USERPROFILE%`. stderr is drained and logged.
- **Calls** don't wait for SolidWorks: MCP tools run outside the model, with a 10-minute timeout.
- State and errors show in Plugins > Installed, with a restart button.
- **Trying a server.** The plugin creator's `plugin_try_mcp` starts one of the user's own plugins' servers on its own
  (a throw-away session id and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, not registered as agent tools), lists its tools, calls one
  read-only tool (or one the user agreed to), and stops it. Sensitive option values are replaced by `[hidden]` in what
  it returns. The panel asks the user before each try.
- **Keys from the agent.** The agent never handles a key: `ask_secret` shows the user a masked field in the chat, and
  the value goes straight to the plugin's encrypted options. The plugin must declare the key in `userConfig` with
  `"sensitive": true`.

## 8. Trust and safety

Hooks and MCP servers run programs on the user's PC, and a tool's `macro.cs` / `preview.cs` (any `.cs` in its folder)
runs C# inside SolidWorks. Unify3D runs them only for plugins whose current hooks, MCP configuration and tool code the
user approved:

- Installing or enabling a plugin with hooks, MCP servers or tools with C# shows every command line it will run and
  every tool with code, and asks once.
- The approval is for exactly those commands and that code (by content). An update, or an edit of a local plugin's
  hooks or MCP servers, that changes them stops them until the user approves again; a tool whose code changed isn't
  offered (ribbon, palette, panel form, `run_tool_macro`, `test_tool`) until then. Tools without C# need no approval,
  and neither do the tools of the user's own plugins in `plugins\local` (they are made in Unify3D, like the user's
  own tools).
- Turns a plugin starts (a wake) never inherit auto-approval: write tools (`execute_csharp`, `run_tool_macro`, `undo`,
  `rebuild`) show the approval card, unless the user chose read-only.
- The agent cannot approve: its plugin tools (`plugin_create`, `plugin_write_file`, `plugin_enable` ...) never do.
- The built-in "unify3d" marketplace is trusted. Third-party marketplaces don't auto-update by default.
- Options > Plugins can turn all plugin hooks or all MCP servers off.

When you write a plugin:

- never put secrets in files; use `userConfig` with `sensitive: true` and read `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>`;
- don't download and run code, and don't send the user's files or chats anywhere the user didn't choose;
- keep data in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`, not in the plugin folder (it is replaced on update);
- treat everything your hook or server receives (prompts, tool inputs, model data) as the user's private data.

## 9. Packaging and sharing: marketplaces

A **marketplace** is a folder or repository with `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, the Claude Code format:

```json
{
  "name": "pu-tools",
  "owner": { "name": "Jane Toolmaker" },
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "pu-mold-shop", "source": "./pu-mold-shop", "description": "...", "version": "1.0.0",
      "category": "Molding & Toolmaking", "keywords": ["molding"] }
  ]
}
```

Plugin `source` kinds:

| Source | Example |
|---|---|
| A folder in the marketplace | `"./pu-mold-shop"` |
| GitHub | `{ "source": "github", "repo": "owner/repo", "ref": "v1.2" }` |
| Git | `{ "source": "git", "url": "https://example.com/repo.git", "ref": "main" }` |
| A folder in a git repository | `{ "source": "git-subdir", "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo.git", "path": "plugin" }` |
| A zip | `{ "source": "url", "url": "https://example.com/plugin.zip" }` |

- Unify3D uses `git.exe` when it is installed. Without git, any `github.com` source (also `git` and `git-subdir`
  URLs on github.com) is downloaded as a zip from codeload.github.com, which only works for **public** repositories.
- A plugin without a `version` is installed under its commit.

### Unify3D fields on a marketplace entry

A marketplace entry may carry a `unify3d` object for plugins whose own files you can't change:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `env` | Environment for that plugin's hooks and MCP servers, applied before the plugin's own `unify3d.env` and its `userConfig` |
| `installWith` | Names of plugins in the same marketplace that are installed together with this one (companions) |
| `hideSkills` | The plugin's skills Unify3D should not offer (e.g. ones written for Claude Code only) |

### Packaging

From the agent: "package my plugin" (`plugin_package`), or Plugins > Create > Package. It writes
`Documents\Unify3D Plugins\<name>-<version>.zip` and a `marketplace.json` next to it that lists the plugin, so that
folder is a ready marketplace.

### Sharing

- **One colleague:** send the zip. They unzip it and add the folder in Plugins > Marketplaces > Add, then install
  from Discover.
- **A team:** put the marketplace on a shared drive or in a git repository. Everyone adds it once (a folder, a git
  URL, or GitHub `owner/repo`); Update brings new versions.
- **Claude Code users** can add the same marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add ...`). Everything but `tools/` works
  there.

Before you share, check the folder for private data: customer names and part numbers, prices, shop rules you don't
want to give away, file paths of your PC, sample models.

## 10. Example: Agent Bridge

The built-in marketplace (`plugins/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in this repository) installs the real
[agent-bridge](https://github.com/msmith297/agent-bridge) plugin unchanged, by reference:

```json
{
  "name": "agent-bridge",
  "source": { "source": "git-subdir", "url": "https://github.com/msmith297/agent-bridge.git", "path": "plugin" },
  "unify3d": {
    "env": { "AGENT_BRIDGE_NAME": "Unify3D SolidWorks - ${UNIFY3D_DEVICE}", "AGENT_BRIDGE_OWNER_PID": "${UNIFY3D_PID}" },
    "installWith": ["agent-bridge-unify3d"],
    "hideSkills": ["revive-session", "agent-bridge-plugin-update", "server-setup"]
  }
}
```

- Its MCP server (`client/mcp.mjs`) reads `AGENT_BRIDGE_NAME` for the seat's name; `AGENT_BRIDGE_OWNER_PID` tells its
  background listener which process to watch (SolidWorks), so a listener whose SolidWorks is gone stops.
- Its hooks (`client/hook.mjs`) use `UserPromptSubmit` and `PostToolUse` to deliver mail, `Stop` to continue a turn
  when mail is waiting, and async `Stop` / `SessionStart` hooks with `--listen` and `asyncRewake` to wake an idle
  agent. `PermissionRequest` (remote approvals) is never fired in Unify3D.
- The companion `plugins/agent-bridge-unify3d` adds a skill for acting on bridge messages inside SolidWorks and the
  `/bridge` command; it has no hooks or MCP servers, so it needs no trust prompt.
- **Known limitation (needs a change in agent-bridge).** Unify3D's MCP client calls itself `unify3d-agent`, and
  agent-bridge's `mcp.mjs` only registers a peer under `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` when its client is Claude Code. So the
  Unify3D peer registers without the session id, and its hooks reach it only by binding through the process tree. After
  a SolidWorks or server restart the hooks keep finding the session's old, offline row and never bind again: no mail is
  injected, nothing wakes, and the bridge name and "listen always" set with `/bridge` are lost. Calling Unify3D
  "claude" instead is not a fix: agent-bridge would count it as part of the user's Claude Code app (its account, its
  Bridge Manager, revive requests). The fix belongs in agent-bridge, e.g. in `client/mcp.mjs` `register()`:
  `SESSION_ID = kind === 'claude' || process.env.UNIFY3D === '1' ? CLAUDE_SESSION_ID : null;` (or the hub re-links a
  stale row for any kind but Claude, as it does for Codex).
- **A local hub's broker.** With agent-bridge set to a local hub, `mcp.mjs` starts its broker as a detached process.
  Under Unify3D it lands in the add-in's job objects, so it ends when that MCP server is stopped (disable, Restart,
  update) or SolidWorks closes; other agents on the PC that use the same local broker lose it until one of them starts
  it again. Hosted hubs are not affected.
