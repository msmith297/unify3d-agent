A new built-in tool "Design compression mold for plastics and resins" (tools/builtin/design-compression-mold) was built in six parallel tracks (A1 data+calculator+record in src/SwAgent/Mold, A2 FE solvers+sweeps in src/SwAgent/Mold/Structural/Fe + tools/dev/MoldSweep, B PropertyManager page extensions, C categories/long runs/ask_selection/panel, D SolidWorks geometry tools + MoldTools.cs, E the tool folder), merged and integrated on this branch; all tests pass. Background: ${DOCS}/contract.md (scope decisions, interfaces), ${DOCS}/design.md, ${DOCS}/critique.md (critique wins), ${DOCS}/research/. ${BUILD}`

  { key: 'engineering', prompt: `ENGINEERING lens. Check the calculator end to end for the user's typical job and for edge cases: units (psi/MPa/lbf/kN/US ton, mm/in, degC/degF), the press force chain (gauge vs on-part vs force reading, ram area), cavity pressure per class, walls/floors/lids/plates (incl. the wall-root factor and the layout-FE finish), bearing and land crush, keys and bolts (scatter, hot proof, LC1x abuse), threads/inserts, fits and dowels at temperature, shrink with each basis, charge/overflow/pour time, temperature gates, lifting limits, stock rounding, split. Reproduce the worked examples (data/validation/examples.json) independently with your own quick calculations (python -I scripts in the scratch folder) and run mold_calc-equivalent calls through MoldCalc.Run in a small test harness if useful. Flag anything that could produce a dangerous, unmachinable or obviously wrong mold, or wrong press settings.` },
  { key: 'solidworks', prompt: `SOLIDWORKS SAFETY lens. Review every new code path that calls the SolidWorks API (src/SwAgent/Mold/Geometry/**, Tools/MoldTools.cs, ModelFiles changes, overlay changes, ToolPage.cs page changes, RebuildTools changes, HiddenDocuments, FileAttachments): calls from timers/background threads, missing null checks, missing try/finally restores (DocumentVisible, EnableGraphicsUpdate, EnableFeatureTree, swStepAP), selection-mark mistakes, body-picking order traps, COM objects used after the document changed, re-entrancy in PropertyManager handlers, anything that can crash or hang SolidWorks or damage the user's document. Verify API names/signatures by reflecting the interop dlls in ${R}/src/SwAgent/bin/Debug/net48 (write a small PowerShell reflection script in the scratch folder).` },
  { key: 'page-panel', prompt: `PAGE + PANEL lens. Review the PropertyManager page extensions (ToolPage.cs, ToolSpec.cs, Units.cs, ToolData.cs, ToolInputs.cs, ToolRunner.cs payload) against tools/builtin/design-compression-mold/inputs.json and its data files (every ChoicesFrom/DependsOn/RowFilter/Fills/ShowWhen/UnitChoices path resolves and behaves as intended; units convert exactly; payload text is what TOOL.md expects), existing tools (Smart Rebuild, the user's tools in %APPDATA%/SwAgent/tools - read only) still render and run unchanged, and the panel side (categories, long runs + sticky settings ending, ask_selection, toolIndex text, drawing attachments) in ui/src. Build the UI and, where useful, reason about the store logic with concrete sequences.` },
  { key: 'procedure', prompt: `PROCEDURE lens. Read tools/builtin/design-compression-mold/TOOL.md as the agent that will run it, with no other context, and check it against the actual tools: every tool name, action and parameter it tells the agent to use exists with that exact schema (read MoldTools.cs, the ask_selection/ask_form/show_overlay definitions, ScriptGlobals Mold.* methods); the phases cover the user's request (blank part or attached part, drawing-only start building the part first, critical faces never get a parting line, overlay highlights of critical surfaces and air traps, questions before building, structural sizing, plate/lid/base weight and size limits, cycle life, setup sheet, machining sheet, hardware BOM, future simulator hooks); stage order (handling before flash system), gates, acceptance A1-A16 measurable with the available tools; nothing contradicts the system prompt rules; the macro.cs gathers what it says. Also check inputs.json order matches the user's ranking (part material/mold material/press pressure/temperature/cavities/limits/cycle life) with the part/drawing group first.` },
